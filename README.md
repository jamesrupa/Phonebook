# Phonebook
> Java Terminal Phonebook Application

A quick and simple java phonebook application. First, it fills parallel arrays with last names, first names, and phone numbers. Then, it prompts the user to choose what to do - lookup, reverse-lookup, add, and quit. Depending on what the user chooses, they enter the credentials asked and gives a response. It keeps doing this until the user indicates they want to stop with the entry of "q". Lastly, it prints out the number of times the computer preforms each action.
