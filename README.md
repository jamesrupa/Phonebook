# Phonebook
**Java Terminal Application**\
*Created By James Rupa*

## Project Description

A phonebook application. First, it fills parallel arrays with last names, first names, and phone numbers. Then, it prompts the user to choose what to do - lookup, reverse-lookup, add, and quit. Depending on what the user chooses, they enter the credentials asked and gives a response. It keeps doing this until the user indicates they want to stop with the entry of "q". Lastly, it prints out the number of times the user preforms the action.
